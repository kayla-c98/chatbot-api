# chatbot-api
Conversational chatbot API implemented with Python and Flask. Will add error responses later (oh and API key)

### Getting Started

Make a GET request to the `/chat` endpoint and pass the desired age, name, and birthday of the bot in the body. Also pass in the message you want the bot to respond to. Endpoint responds with bot's repsonse to the message.
